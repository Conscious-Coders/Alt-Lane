# Conscious Compassion

A recent increase of harassment, hate crimes and assault incidents in New York City has negatively impacted various communities and their quality of life. Conscious Compassion aims to empower individuals who have been affected by creating a space to inform others and reach out for support. As an open forum, community members are able post their experiences which allows other individuals in the area to be vigilant and better equipped to make calculated decisions. 
Conscious Compassion builds community by bringing awareness of unlawful behavior with open discussions.
