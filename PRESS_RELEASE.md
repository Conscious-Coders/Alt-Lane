# Project Name #
Alt-Lane 

## Heading ##
Alt-Lane brings alternative career paths to high school students via mentorship.

## Sub-Heading ##
Alt-Lane allows high school students to explore alternative paths to find their true passion by building a network of mentors. 

## Summary ##
College may not be the next step for every highschool student. A majority of students are lost because there is a lack of support and a gap in the knowledge available around alternative paths to employment.  Alt-Lane is a website to bring information about career opportunities to high school students. Students will be exposed to alternative careers paths in their chosen fields via a network of mentors. 

## Problem ##
Students struggle to find mentors to help them plan their next steps during the final year of highschool. There is a lack of knowledge available to high school students regarding alternative paths regarding careers they may want to pursue.

## Solution ##
Alt-Lane will give students access to mentors from various fields to help guide their journey in finding their path. With our online platform students will be able to connect with industry professionals and gain meaningful insight.

## Key Technical Challenge ##
Building the user authentication system and using jest for testing will be the most challenging aspect of the project since these components are new to all members of the team. We want to implement chat features in the platform that will also be a technical challenge. 

## Extension Opportunities ##
- Creating an meeting system using a calendar
- Chat system to allow mentors and mentees to communicate
  - Parent will get a copy of chat conversation
- Add Organizations as a user type to add programs
